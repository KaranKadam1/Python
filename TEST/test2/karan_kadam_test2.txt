Q1)write a program to print first n prime numbers

num = int(input("enter num= "))

for n in range(1,num):
    for i in range(2,n):
        if(n%i == 0):
            break

    else:
        print(n,end=" ")


Q2)Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user. 
1/1! + 2/2! + 3/3! + 4/4! + ... N/N!

n = int(input("enter num= "))

sum = 0
fact = 1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact= fact*i
    sum += (i/fact)
print("sum of series= ",sum)


Q3)Write a program to accept basic salary of n emp. (n should be accepted from user).
If basic salary is below 20000 then da=10%,ta=12% and hra=15% otherwise da=15%,ta=18% and hra=20%. 
Based on this calculate the total salary of each emp and also total salary of all emp.

n = int(input("enter num of employees="))

for i in range(1,n+1):
    basic_salary = int(input("enter salary= "))
    total = 0 

    if(basic_salary<20000):
        da = basic_salary *(10/100)
        hra = basic_salary*(15/100)
        ta = basic_salary*(12/100)
        total += basic_salary + da +hra +ta
       
    else:
        da = basic_salary*(15/100)
        hra = basic_salary*(20/100)
        ta = basic_salary*(18/100)
        total += basic_salary + da +hra +ta
    print("salary of employee= ",total,"Rs")

total+= da +hra +ta + basic_salary
print("total salay of all employee= ",total,"Rs")


Q4)We want to estimate the cost of painting a property. Interior wall painting cost  
is Rs.18 per sq.ft. and exterior wall painting cost is Rs.12 per sq.ft. 
Take input as
1. Number of Interior walls
2. Number of Exterior walls
3. Surface Area of each Interior Wall in units of square feet
4. Surface Area of each Exterior Wall in units of square feet

interior = int(input("Enter no of interior walls \n"))
exterior = int(input("Enter no of exterior walls \n"))

surface_interior = 0
surface_exterior = 0

for i in range(0, interior):
   n = float(input("Enter interior walls area \n"))
   surface_interior += n

for i in range(0, exterior):
   n2 = float(input("Enter exterior walls area \n"))
   surface_exterior += n2

cost_interior = surface_interior*18
cost_exterior = surface_exterior*12

total_cost = cost_exterior + cost_interior
print("Total cost= ",total_cost,"INR")
